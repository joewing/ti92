>Libraries
This program requires flib, gray4lib, and hexlib.

>Installation
You must have Fargo II installed on your calculator to run this
program. I have created it and tested on a TI-92 version 1.11.

>Description
This is a TI-92 Fargo II game; Breakout! The object of Breakout is to
break all the bricks in a level by bouncing the ball off of them. You
must prevent the ball from hitting the ground with the paddle while
trying to aim at the bricks as well. When you hit a brick, sometimes
a falling block will fall out of it. Some of these falling blocks do
good things and some of them do not. You will soon figure out what
each does.
This program is not yet finished. I have many more features I would
like to add and fix. It shound not crash at least...

>Keys
Use the right/left arrow keys to move the paddle.
[F1] starts the ball in motion.
[MODE] pauses the game and shuts off the calculator.
[(backspace)] takes away one life and puts the ball on the paddle.
Use the keyboard to enter your intials if you get a high score.
